title: JavaScript Practice
---

This is a collection of exercises and challenges to practice JavaScript, based on [the Javascript course at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

Often when working with JavaScript, particularly in the frontend, you also have to manipulate the DOM (HTML) or use styles (CSS). These exercises will allow you to practice both JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation/styling, which is missing from the Codecademy course.

There may also be indications on git usage, although you don't need git to practice these challenges. However, I recommend learning git as soon as possible as you will use it everyday in your professional life as a developer.

The solutions may not be "production-ready" JavaScript, but they are perfect for the level they represent. This is a vanilla JavaScript course.
