This is a collection of exercises and challenges to practice JavaScript, based on [the Ruby course at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

If you come from learning JavaScript, you may find [this comparison between both languages](comparison-ruby-js) useful.

To practice the first Ruby lessons, head over to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and do the challenges there. You can join with your GitHub account.

Codewars has katas in several languages with tests, ordered by tags and by difficulty, where 8kyu are the easiest and 1kyu are the hardest. Choose the language, then choose the difficulty, then filter by tag. Finally, choose a kata and press **train**.

To practice the last Ruby lessons, head over to the challenges.
