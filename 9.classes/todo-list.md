SVG
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction
based on XML, as HTML once was. It basically means that you have specific named tags to create specific elements, and they can have attributes and be applied styles or be targeted with javascript.

Example:

```markup
<svg width= "400" height= "400">
<circle cx= "100" cy= "100" r="90" stroke= "red" stroke-width="1" fill="grey" />
Sorry but this browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>
```

produces:

<svg width= "400" height= "400">
<circle cx= "100" cy= "100" r="90" stroke= "red" stroke-width="1" fill="grey" />
Sorry but this browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>

you can give it a class


or target it with js
