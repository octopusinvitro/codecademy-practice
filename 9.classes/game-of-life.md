title: Game of life

**Challenge:** We are going to build [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton devised by John Conway in 1970. It's not a game in the sense that the user interacts with the user interface during the game, but rather it's more of an artificial intelligence that, starting with initial conditions set up by the user, evolves on its own.

**THE RULES**

**For a space that is 'populated':**
* Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

**For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'**
* Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

**To practice:** Clases
